//The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers whose first and second elements are 1. To generate further elements of the sequence we take the sum of the previous two elements. For example the first 6 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Write a function fibonacci that takes in a number length and returns the fibonacci sequence up to the given length.


function fibonacci(length) {
    if (length === 0) {
        return [];
    } else if (length === 1) {
        return [1];
    }

    let seq = [1,1];

    while (seq.length < length) {
        let last = seq[seq.length - 1];
        let secondToLast = seq[seq.length - 2];
        let nextEle = last + secondToLast;
        seq.push(nextEle);
    }

    return seq;
}
